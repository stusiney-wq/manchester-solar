        <h2>Norfolk Solar FAQs</h2>
        <div class="section-divider-accent"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Are solar panels actually worth it in Norfolk?</summary>
          <p>Absolutely. With Norfolk's decent 4.0 peak sun hours, 0% VAT until 2027, and typical ¬£1,950/year savings, most systems pay for themselves in 6-8 years then give you 15+ years of virtually free electricity. Commercial systems often pay back in just 3-5 years.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do solar panels work on cloudy days?</summary>
          <p>Yes, they work brilliantly. Panels generate electricity from daylight, not just direct sunshine. Even on Norfolk's cloudiest days, you'll still get 20-30% of peak output. It's the yearly performance that matters, not daily ups and downs.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What's this about selling electricity back to the grid?</summary>
          <p>When your panels produce more than you're using, the excess automatically goes to the grid and you get paid through the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG). Rates vary but typically 4-15p per kWh ‚Äì that's an extra ¬£200-600/year in your pocket.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need a battery with my solar panels?</summary>
          <p>Not essential, but batteries store excess solar for evening use, increasing savings by 20-40%. Without a battery, you use solar during the day and grid electricity at night. Our quote system shows costs and benefits of both options.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I charge my electric car with solar?</summary>
          <p>Yes! Solar + EV charging is highly effective in Norfolk. Charge your car with free solar electricity during the day. A typical home system can provide 8,000-12,000 miles of free EV driving per year.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is there funding or grants available?</summary>
          <p>Solar has 0% VAT until March 2027 (saving ¬£800-1,600). Some local councils offer green home grants. Low-cost finance is available through Hometree and other providers. Commercial premises may access additional business grants.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I have to own my home to get solar?</summary>
          <p>Yes, you need to own the property or have explicit landlord permission for permanent installation. Solar panels become part of the building and typically increase property value by 2-4%.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How long do solar panels last and do they need maintenance?</summary>
          <p>Panels last 25+ years with minimal maintenance - just occasional cleaning and annual checks. Inverters may need replacement after 10-15 years. Most systems come with 20-25 year performance warranties.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I monitor my solar system performance?</summary>
          <p>Yes! Modern systems include smartphone apps showing real-time generation, household consumption, grid export, and savings. Track daily, monthly, and annual performance easily.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I still need my electricity supplier with solar?</summary>
          <p>Yes, you remain connected to the grid for evening/winter electricity and to export excess solar. Many suppliers offer solar-friendly tariffs with cheap overnight rates for battery charging. Solar reduces your bills, doesn't eliminate them entirely.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if my roof isn't suitable for solar panels?</summary>
          <p>Our AI analysis checks roof suitability instantly - age, material, direction, and shading. Most Norfolk roofs work well. South-facing is ideal, but east/west roofs still deliver good returns. Even north-facing commercial roofs can be viable for large systems.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will solar panels damage my roof or cause leaks?</summary>
          <p>No. Professional MCS installers use proven mounting systems that don't compromise roof integrity. Panels actually protect the roof area underneath. sq1i includes full insurance and guarantees against any installation-related issues.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What happens to my solar during power cuts?</summary>
          <p>Standard grid-tied systems shut off during power cuts for safety (protecting line workers). If you want backup power, you need a battery system with backup capability - this keeps essential circuits running during outages.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will solar panels affect my home insurance?</summary>
          <p>Most insurers cover solar at no extra cost - panels often reduce premiums as they protect roof areas. Always notify your insurer. MCS certification ensures installations meet insurance requirements. sq1i provides full installation insurance.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if I want to sell my house with solar panels?</summary>
          <p>Solar typically increases property value by 2-4% and makes homes sell faster. Buyers love lower electricity bills. All warranties transfer to new owners. EPC ratings improve, which is increasingly important for property sales.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How disruptive is solar panel installation?</summary>
          <p>Installation typically takes 1-2 days. Scaffolding goes up day before, panels installed, then scaffolding removed. Electricity is off for 2-4 hours during connection. Minimal noise, no internal disruption. You can stay in your home throughout.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if the savings estimates turn out to be wrong?</summary>
          <p>Our clever AI system uses real Norfolk weather data and your actual electricity usage, so estimates are typically very accurate. Savings do vary year by year due to weather, but the 25-year performance is predictable. Most customers actually exceed their estimates because electricity prices keep rising.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Are there hidden costs I should know about?</summary>
          <p>Our quotes include everything: panels, inverters, installation, scaffolding, electrical work, DNO applications. No hidden costs. Optional extras like batteries or EV charging are clearly shown separately. Fixed-price quotes valid for 30 days.</p>
